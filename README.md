## Build Automation with Maven

This assignment aims to introduce us to the world of Maven, including structure, build automation and documentation. It furthermore requires us to make use of the knowledge we gained so far in the lecture, to successfully complete this assignment.

The template used can be found here: [Queue Project Template][template]

### Queue Exercise

The template project already includes an interface for a queue as well as an implementation for strings. However, there are some implementation issues that should be fixed. Additionally, in the course of this assignment a second implementation, using generics, will be added to use the queue with any class/object.

### Task list

These following points were/will be handled during this assignment (subject to changes):

- [x] General description in Readme

- [x] Edit pom.xml meta infos
